**Describing the Relationship Between Two Continuous Variables**

1.  Describe the relationship (strength and direction) between two continuous variables using the statistical technique of correlation analysis

2.  Describe the relationship (estimation or prediction) between two continuous variables using the statistical technique of regression analysis

3.  Introduce the assumptions for performing a simple linear regression analysis and interpret the regression coefficients

4.  Discuss the concept of centering covariates in a linear regression analysis

5.  Identify a linear regression model as a type of generalized linear model

6.  Apply the statistical techniques of correlation analysis and regression analysis to assess relationships in data sets
